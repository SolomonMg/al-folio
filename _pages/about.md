I am a Research Scientist at [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/people/messing-solomon/), supporting [Social Science One](https://socialscience.one). I also served as founding Managing Director at Pew Research Centerâ€™s [Data Labs](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/23/qa-with-solomon-messing-of-pew-research-centers-data-labs/). My research interests center on how algorithms and social information affect behavior, with an emphasis on politics, news and social media.
