I am a (Principal) Research Scientist at Facebook, Affiliated Researcher at Georgetown, and formerly the founding Director at Pew Research Center’s [Data Labs](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/23/qa-with-solomon-messing-of-pew-research-centers-data-labs/). I use large scale complex experimentation, behavioral data from the web, and surveys to study how people understand and react to social information.  Lately I've been working on using privacy tech to unlock research/ML/AI in corporate data warehouses. My work has been published in Science, the American Political Science Review, Public Opinion Quarterly, Communication Research, Radiology and Pediatric Radiology. My book “The Impression of Influence” was published by Princeton University Press.
